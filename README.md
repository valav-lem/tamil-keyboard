# Yazhi Tamil Keyboard (Thozhan)

An open-source Tamil keyboard reimagined with Tholkappiam (PM0100) principles.

## Philosophy: PM0100 Unit Pairs

Instead of traditional layouts (QWERTY-phonetic or Tamil99), we are designing a layout based on the phonological units defined in Tholkappiam.

**Core Concept:** Sounds are grouped in natural pairs or units:
- A (அ) / Aa (ஆ)
- E (இ) / Ee (ஈ)
- U (உ) / Uu (ஊ)

## Goals
- Intuitive typing flow based on sound duration (Maatthirai) and relationship.
- Support for modern platforms (Mobile/Web/Desktop).
- Privacy-focused (local processing).

## Roadmap
1. [ ] Define the full layout spec (Vowels, Consonants, Grantha).
2. [ ] Prototype a web-based testing ground (with offline caching).
3. [ ] Build keymap configuration.
4. [ ] Integrate Adhan (Local Processing & Prediction Engine).
5. [ ] Package for target OS (Android/iOS/Linux).
